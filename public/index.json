[{"content":"Getting started with a Hugo blog Getting started with a Hugo blog was an endeavor I\u0026rsquo;ve started a couple of times. Since i started working within Microsoft 365 I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in sharing my knowledge. Mainly due to some popular bloggers and the insane amount of knowledge they can share. In the past I\u0026rsquo;ve tried blogging with a few amazing technologies because they we\u0026rsquo;re interesting to me. I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in NextJS, done some stuff with React and tried Gatsby for some static site rendering. This was all an amazing learning experience but i missed the underlying knowledge and always tried to over engineer this. Then i stepped upon Hugo, which was a few years ago. It seemed so simple and i was able to whip up a site within 10 minutes through templates and an instruction. This felt like magic. However i fell down in my own trap and tried to over engineer this site and get everything in there, a profile page, my resume, amazing search functionality. This caused me to not start actually blogging and it stayed in the development phase.\nWhat is different this time? This time I\u0026rsquo;m doing a few things different, these are related to technical depth, writing workflow and the reason to write.\nTechnical depth I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen one of the most popular Hugo templates to start with. This caused there to be a lot of documentation out there to start with. The Hugo Papermod template is amazing from the start and very easily customizable\nWriting workflow Initially writing in markdown caused a lot of issues, it felt clunky and difficult. for my Personal Knowledge Management I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Obsidian for some time now and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing and i don\u0026rsquo;t notice I\u0026rsquo;m working with markdown. This in combination with some templating allows me to easily create pages and publish them to the world!\nReason to write Initially my reason to write was to become part of the Microsoft 365 community and in essence profile myself to potential employers. Now my reasoning is a lot more intrinsic that i want to document my work and make it available to others to discuss about and learn from to community whilst giving.\nHow is my current blog setup The blog is currently setup very simple. It\u0026rsquo;s making use of the following components, which i will go into depth a bit later.\nHugo - Papermod Theme Github Obsidian Templater plugin Azure Static site Hugo I\u0026rsquo;ve started with a simple Hugo project and followed the documentation from the Papermod Theme to get started. Which was as simple as following the installation guide: Installation Â· adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod Wiki and within 5 minutes the Hugo site was running locally. What i needed to do to get it working was create two pages, called Archives and search with the information found and had to adjust my config.yaml to add some information regarding my specific use cases. This was as simple as it could be.\nGitHub Getting started and pushing the repository to GitHub was simple. I\u0026rsquo;ve published the code directly from Visual Studio code and created a new respository.\nObsidian Azure Static site I\u0026rsquo;ve created a static site and created with the guide from Deploy a Hugo site to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn For all the relevant information.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-started-with-a-hugo-blog/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"getting-started-with-a-hugo-blog\"\u003eGetting started with a Hugo blog\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting started with a Hugo blog was an endeavor I\u0026rsquo;ve started a couple of times.
