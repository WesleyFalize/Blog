# Organizing AZ-204
Getting started with the AZ-204 has been very difficult. I've been fond of getting to know the aspects of the Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps because i need those for my daily job. All the other aspects of the exam are not really relevant for me. To adjust this i'm going to start using this blog to learn and organize my thoughts around the AZ-204 exam. The AZ-204 Exam exists of the learnings paths that i will follow and labs that I will do.
