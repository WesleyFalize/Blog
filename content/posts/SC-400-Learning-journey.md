# Premise

The SC-400 is a certification is a very broad certification that focusses on Microsoft 365 compliancy. I want to obtain this certification to showcase I'm familiar with the content. However, it's been one of the toughest certifications I've trained for. In my day-to-day job i work with certain areas of Microsoft Purview like sensitivity labels, retention policies but getting hands-on experience with areas like eDiscovery, Insider Risk Management and the privacy features. Within this blog i would like to share my learning journey.

# How do i study?

I'm a pretty visual learner and in the past, I've been creating mind maps to collate the topics against each other. During this phase i want to do this as well but in the meantime also share my progress and learning through this blog. If someone reads this that's fine. But my main goal is to learn the topics enough to summarize and explain them to someone else.

# Structure

During my study for the SC-400 i will follow the Microsoft 365 learning path that has been provided for this certification. I will create blogs for each of main topics, and if needed will dive into detail for each of these topics in subsets of posts, upfront i will grade my level of knowledge about the topics and will do the same after finishing the learning path for this.
