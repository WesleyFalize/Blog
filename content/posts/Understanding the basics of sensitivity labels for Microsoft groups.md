# Why Use a Sensitivity Label
A sensitivity label is a quick and effective way to see what kind of policy is enforced on a Microsoft 365 group. It gives you better control over governance in your environment and helps end users understand what type of data they can safely store in a specific team. For example, if a team is labeled as "External," users know not to store documents meant only for internal use. While this is a simple example, sensitivity labels can provide deeper insights depending on your organization's needs.

## What is a Sensitivity Label?
A sensitivity label in Microsoft 365 is a tool for classifying and protecting data based on its sensitivity. By applying labels, you can enforce protection policies like encryption, access restrictions, and even visual markings. These labels ensure sensitive information is handled appropriately and consistently across your organization.

The great thing about sensitivity labels is how customizable they are. You can adapt them to meet your organization’s specific needs. For instance, a "Confidential" label could restrict sharing outside your company and require encryption, while a "Public" label might not have these restrictions.
### Key Features of Sensitivity Labels
- **Classification**: Helps you tag data with labels that reflect its sensitivity.
- **Protection**: Lets you enforce policies such as encryption or access control.
- **User Awareness**: Makes it clear to users how they should handle certain types of information.
- **Governance**: Supports data compliance and governance requirements.

In short, sensitivity labels are a vital tool for organizations wanting to secure their data while maintaining a productive Microsoft 365 environment.

### How Sensitivity Labels Work with Groups

Sensitivity labels can also be applied to entire Microsoft 365 groups. This influences how resources tied to the group—such as SharePoint sites, Teams, and Outlook mailboxes—behave.

### Benefits for Organizations

1. **Better Security**: Sensitivity labels help protect data from unauthorized access and accidental sharing.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: They support industry standards and ensure proper data handling.
3. **Guidance for Users**: By assigning labels, team owners can set clear expectations about how a group’s data should be used.

In summary, sensitivity labels make it easier to manage and secure your organization's data. They strike the right balance between enabling collaboration and maintaining control. In the next blog i will go into what you can configure!
